# Overview of Machine Learning 

You can see an [overview of machine learning here](/Overview-of-ML/Overview-of-ML.pdf).

# C++ Data Exploration 

In this program, I explored the data set, Boston.csv. I performed statistical analysis on two attributes, rm and medv, to find the covariance and correlation. 

Here you may read an overview of [C++ Data Exploration](/C++_Program/Overview-of-C++.pdf) or [review the code](/C++_Program/dataexploration.cpp).

# Linear Models

In this analysis, the data set bike.csv was explored using [linear regression](/Linear-Models/Regression.pdf) and the data set accelerometer.csv was explored using [classification](/Linear-Models/Classification.pdf).

# Machine Learning from Scratch

Read through two C++ programs exploring the titanic.csv data set, using the machine learning algorithms, [logistic regression](/ML-from-Scratch/logistic_regression.cpp) and [naive bayes](/ML-from-Scratch/naive-bayes.cpp). Overview document can be seen [here](/ML-from-Scratch/ml_from_scratch).
